# Robotic Handwriting via SVG-to-Motion Pipeline (Dobot)
An end-to-end robotic handwriting system that converts SVG vector strokes into physical brushstrokes via computer vision, geometric path planning, and real-world robot control.
## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end robotic handwriting system that enables a Dobot robotic arm to write characters and full poems by converting SVG vector strokes into physical pen motions.<br>
The system bridges computer graphics, geometric path planning, and real-world robot control, transforming abstract vector representations into precise, repeatable handwriting on paper.
